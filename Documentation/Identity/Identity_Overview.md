# OSIsoft Identity Service

OSIsoft Identity Service APIs make it possible to create, read, update and delete tenants, clients, users and other indentiy related objects. Users and clients have access to their own information and when given other roles, such as Admin can access information for all objects in their Tenant. You can read more about specific roles under the Management topic.
